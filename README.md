# Beta diversity North America

This is a repository for our paper "Patterns of beta diversity of vascular plants and their correspondence with biome boundaries across North America"

The repository includes the R functions to calculate Beta diversity and its components (i.e., turnover and nestedness) for taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dimensions of vascular plants in North America.

The main R functions "betaDivSpatial" and "betaDivPhyloTraitSpatial" were modified slightly from the function "betagrid" of Jose Hidasi that can be found here: http://rfunctions.blogspot.com/2015/08/calculating-beta-diversity-on-grid.html
